# MDST-FARS-share

This repo is a start where Tiapei Xie, Sheng Yang and Sean Ma are collaborating together for the goal of becoming the top notch Data Scientiest. We started with the the MDST-FARS competition.

## Mission:
### Helping each other to become the top Data Scientist in our field.

## Goals:
We use competitions in Kaggle to sharpen our skill sets. Our main goal is to get placed in the public leader board. Pratical goals for now are:

1. Further test FARS data set with ensemble technologies (Tianpei & Sean).
2. Practice deep learning on FARS data set (Tianpei lead).
3. Continue to learn from 2 public Kaggle competitions (Home Depot; Santander) (Sheng lead).
5. Learn cloud technologies such as AWS (Sean lead).
4. Compete in a public Kaggle competition (maybe in May or June).
